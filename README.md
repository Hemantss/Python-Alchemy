This repository contains the example code and demonstration projects from the book Python Alchemy. It is designed to accompany the book by providing hands-on, runnable implementations of the concepts, patterns, and techniques discussed throughout each chapter.

The code is organized to reflect the structure of the book, making it easy to follow along, experiment with ideas, and deepen your practical understanding of Python. From foundational language features to advanced topics, these examples are intended to be clear, well-documented, and easy to extend.

Whether you are reading the book sequentially or exploring specific topics, this repository serves as a practical reference and a sandbox for learning, experimentation, and real-world application.
